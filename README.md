# IMStalker #
Simple COM interop tool that will keep track of IM contacts' status changes.

## Installation ##
You need Skype for this program to work. Earlier versions (1.5 and earlier) used
Live Messenger (MSN), however since I don't use Messenger any more and Microsoft
themselves are dropping support in favor of Skype I changed it to Skype instead
starting from version 1.5s.

## Usage ##
Just type a login name of the user you want to track and press enter. The activity
will be saved to a log file in the same directory as the .exe file. If you want to
track someone you have previously tracked, you can select them from the dropdown (it
lists all the users whose logs it can find so delete the logs to clear this list).
